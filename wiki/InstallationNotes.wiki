#summary Installation Notes.

= Introduction =

This page is intended to provide the necessary information needed to install
the libraries and files needed to begin using capirca.

This page will hopefully change rapidly as the code is migrated from its Google roots and to open source, and while the new structure of the code and usage is finalized.  Unfortunately, this page may be frequently out of date for short periods, but we will strive to keep it current.

In its current form, this page is intended to provide a quick-start guide.  See the other wiki pages for more details.

= Details =

==Install Ipaddr.py==
*Download http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/

**Copy to python installation ./lib directory

==Install Ply==
*Download http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/

**In ply-3.3 directory, copy ./ply subdirectory to python lib

==Install Capirca libraries==
*Download http://code.google.com/p/capirca

**Copy the ./lib directory to your python install library

==Generate Naming, Policy, and Platform Generator Output==
*Import naming library and create [NamingLibrary naming object from definitions files]
{{{
  from capirca import naming
  defs = naming.Naming(‘./def/’)
}}}
*Import policy library, read in the [PolicyFormat policy data], and create a policy object
{{{
  from capirca import policy
  conf = open(‘./policy/sample.pol’).read()
  pol = policy.ParsePolicy(conf, defs, optimize=True)
}}}
*Import a generator library and output a policy in the desired format
{{{
  from capirca import juniper
  for header in pol.headers:
    if ‘juniper’ in header.platforms:
      jcl = True …
  if jcl:
    output = juniper.Juniper(pol)

    print output
