#summary Installation Notes.

= Introduction =

This page is intended to provide the necessary information needed to install
the libraries and files needed to begin using capirca.

This page will hopefully change rapidly as the code is migrated from its Google roots and to open source, and while the new structure of the code and usage is finalized.  Unfortunately, this page may be frequently out of date for short periods, but we will strive to keep it current.

In its current form, this page is intended to provide a quick-start guide.  See the other wiki pages for more details.

= Details =

==Quick Start==
In the install directory, simply run:
{{{
python aclgen.py -d def -p policies/sample.pol -o filters
}}}
This should generate sample output filters for cisco, juniper and iptables from the provided sample.pol policy file and the predefined network and service definitions.

==Manually Generating Naming, Policy, and Platform Generator Output==
*Import naming library and create [NamingLibrary naming object from definitions files]
{{{
  from capirca import naming
  defs = naming.Naming(‘./def/’)
}}}
*Import policy library, read in the [PolicyFormat policy data], and create a policy object
{{{
  from capirca import policy
  conf = open(‘./policy/sample.pol’).read()
  pol = policy.ParsePolicy(conf, defs, optimize=True)
}}}
*Import a generator library and output a policy in the desired format
{{{
  from capirca import juniper
  for header in pol.headers:
    if ‘juniper’ in header.platforms:
      jcl = True …
  if jcl:
    output = juniper.Juniper(pol)

    print output
}}}
